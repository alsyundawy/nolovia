# nolovia dynamic DNS provider blacklist file
# Part of nolovia, <https://github.com/parseword/nolovia/>
#
# The following domains provide dynamic DNS services. Dynamic DNS has valid and
# legitimate uses, especially for people on unreliable internet connections. 
# However, in recent years, bad actors have begun abusing dynamic DNS services 
# to distribute malware, mask spam endpoints, and route botnet command and 
# control infrastructure.
#
# None of the domains in this list are malicious on their own. Nolovia defaults 
# to blocking them due to the abuse potential, and in order to flatten what 
# would otherwise be hundreds of individual zones into a handful instead.
#
# If you need to connect to a site hosted by one of these providers, you may 
# want to disable this list in the config.php file, or add the specific domain
# to your personal-whitelist.txt file.
